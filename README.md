# CODTECH-IT-Java-Internship-Tasks
This repository contains the four mandatory tasks completed during my Java Development Internship at CODTECH IT Solutions. Each task demonstrates a core area of Java development, ranging from basic file handling to advanced multithreading and AI integration.

# 📁 Project Structure
*Task 1*: File Handling Utility * Description: A Java program to read, write, and modify text files using java.io and java.nio packages.

Key Features: Creating new files, appending data, and searching for specific text within a file.

*Task 2*: REST API Client * Description: An application that consumes a public REST API to fetch real-time data and parse JSON responses.

Key Features: HTTP request handling, JSON parsing (using libraries like Gson or Jackson), and structured data display.

*Task 3*: Multithreaded Chat Application * Description: A real-time client-server communication system built using Java Sockets.

Key Features: Multithreading to handle multiple concurrent clients and synchronized message broadcasting.

*Task 4*: AI-Based Recommendation System * Description: A recommendation engine that suggests content/products based on user preferences.

*Key Features*: Data processing using libraries (like Apache Mahout) and collaborative filtering logic.
